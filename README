DnTaPaTa
--------

This mediawiki plugin allows Djembe and Dunun rythms to be added to a mediawiki. Rythms are notated as in the following example:

<djembe>
Gn Ta Pa Ta Gn en Pa en
</djembe>

The pluging will then render a grahphical (piano roll-like) representation of such a rythm.

subdirectory and upload all the png-images in the images subdirectory.
